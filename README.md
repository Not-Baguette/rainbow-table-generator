# rainbow-table-generator
Generates a SHA-1 (Will add more later like SHA-256) Hashes from most common passwords. 

P.S. I don't know alot about Rainbow tables but this should work

## Credit
- [Most Common Passwords Repository](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/tree/aad07fff50ca37af2926de4d07ff670bf3416fbc/Passwords), You can change the url to others by opening other files, clicking `raw`, and copy-pasting the url.

## TODO
- Add SHA-256 and others
